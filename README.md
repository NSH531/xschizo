This project deals with computerized decoding of fMRI scans from the COBRE database in order to find an unequivocal biomarker of schizophrenia

</h3>
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that allows researchers to non-invasively measure brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. It has been used to study various psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia.

Finding an "unequivocal biomarker" of schizophrenia, or any other psychiatric condition, is a complex and ongoing process. There is currently no single test or marker that can definitively diagnose schizophrenia or any other mental health disorder. Rather, diagnosis is typically based on a combination of factors, including a detailed assessment of an individual's symptoms, medical history, and other relevant information.

That being said, research on the use of fMRI and other neuroimaging techniques to identify potential biomarkers for schizophrenia is an active area of study. By analyzing patterns of brain activity in individuals with schizophrenia, researchers may be able to identify unique patterns or characteristics that could potentially serve as biomarkers for the disorder. However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential of these techniques and how they may be used in clinical practice.
